 * \mainpage Project for IUT Grand Ouest Normandie, 
 * computer science department.
 *
 * \section description Description of the project
 * This project aims to implement a two-player board game. 
 * The rules of the game are described below.
 * 
 * The project is divided into several files. The game engine, which
 * implements the detailed rules, is mainly provided in the files board.c and board.h
 *
 * \section rules Detailed rules of the game.
 * 
 * The game is played by two players, referred to as ::NORTH_P and ::SOUTH_P,
 * on a six by six square board with two goals.
 * One goal is located at the north of the board,
 * adjacent to the six northernmost squares, 
 * and the other is at the south, 
 * adjacent to the six southernmost squares.
 *
 * The objective of each player is to be the first to bring a piece 
 * to the opponent's goal.
 * 
 * There are 12 pieces on the board: four pieces of each of the three sizes 
 * (::ONE, ::TWO and ::THREE).
 * Pieces do not belong to any player and may be used by either player.
 *
 * \subsection setting Setting up of the game
 * During the first phase of the game, players must place their pieces on the board,
 * on the row closest to their side. 
 * Each player places two pieces of each size. 
 * They may or may not alternate turns when placing pieces 
 * (using the function ::place_piece).
 * Once each player has placed six pieces, the game begins. 
 *
 * \subsection moves Moving pieces
 * On their turn, each player picks a piece from the row closest 
 * to their side on the board (using the function ::pick_piece) and moves it 
 * (using function ::move_piece).
 * The piece must move a number of steps equal to its ::size, 
 * with each step in one of the four possible directions
 * (::SOUTH, ::NORTH, ::EAST, ::WEST) toward an empty square. 
 * Only the last move may be toward an occupied position, 
 * in which case the piece _bounces_ off the other piece
 * and continues its move with a number of steps 
 * equal to the ::size of the other piece.
 * 
 * A piece may only enter the opponent goal with its last move 
 * (possibly after several bounces),
 * resulting into the current player winning the game.
 * 
 * \subsection special Special move
 * When a piece reaches another piece's position at the end of its move,
 * the player has an additional option (function ::swap_piece).
 * Instead of bouncing off the piece, 
 * the player may replace the reached piece with the moving piece 
 * and then place the removed piece on any empty square of the board
 * (excluding the goals). This concludes the current player's turn.
